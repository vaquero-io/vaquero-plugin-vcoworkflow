  # Comments are based on general platform definition file options.
  # When creating custom provider plugin, update the comments
  # based on the specific requirements of the provider.

  # Platform have one or more environment.
  #
  # Example: array of strings
  #
  # environments:
  #   - int
  #   - qa
  #   - stage
  #   - prod
  #
  environments:
    -

  # Individual virtual machines have an associated node name.
  # These are passed to the provider plugin module and are
  # constructed at build time based on the pattern you define
  # here. Available options are:
  #
  # environment    environment name from the key above
  # component      component name
  # instance       single leading zero 0..9, up to count of component pool
  # geo            first letter of geo key value
  # 'string'       any single quoted string, escape char not evaluated
  #
  # Example: array of strings
  #
  # nodename:
  #   - environment
  #   - '-'
  #   - component
  #   - instance
  #
  #   would result in => "dev-api01"
  #
  nodename:
    - 'node'
    - instance

  # You can add any other custom attributes to the platform definition
  # by creating additional yml files with key values. The referenced
  # files are, by convention, assumed to have the following structure:
  #
  # tags:
  #
  #   tagset1: &tagset1
  #     key1: value
  #     key2: value
  #     ...
  #
  #   tagset2:
  #     <<: *tagset1
  #     key2: override value
  #
  #
  # Example: array of string
  #
  # references:
  #   path: 'infrastructure/'
  #   keyfiles:
  #     - tags
  #

  # Pools are used to define all the required elements of a component.
  # If you have a front-end web tier, the number of servers in the pool,
  # the ram, cpu, image to use, etc, are all defined in a pool
  # definition.
  #
  # The keys defined in this template are considered required for this plugin
  # though you can add additional keys either through references files
  # or directly.
  #
  # vcenter         reference to record set in vcenter required file
  # network         reference to record set in network required file
  # compute         reference to record set in compute required file
  # count           The number of components in the load balance pool
  # runlist         Chef runlist(s) for the node, array of strings
  # componentrole   optional custom role created by substituting the component name for # in the supplied string
  # chefserver      url for chef server
  # addresses       not necessary to define specific values in a pool definition, must include array of IP in component
  #
  # Example
  #
  # pools:
  #   webdefault: &webdefault
  #     vcenter: nonprod
  #     network: devweb
  #     compute: nonprodweb
  #     count: 2
  #     runlist:
  #       - 'role[loc_uswest]'
  #       - 'role[base]'
  #     componentrole: 'role[aw_#]'
  #     chefserver: https://manage.chef.io

  # Components define the actual nodes in the platform and a passed as a hash to the provider plugin.

  #     compute: prodapi
  #     addresses:
  #       - 10.0.0.1
